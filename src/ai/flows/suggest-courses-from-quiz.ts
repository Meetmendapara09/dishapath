  Analyze the student's quiz results and any stated career goals to recommend suitable academic streams (Arts, Science, Commerce) and specific courses.

  **Most importantly**, you must provide a strong, detailed, and personalized rationale for your suggestions. In the 'rationale' field, explain exactly how the quiz results (e.g., "enjoys solving puzzles," "prefers working with hands") and career goals align with the recommended streams and courses. Make direct connections.

  **Quiz Results:**
  {{{quizResult}}}

  **Career Goals (if any):**
  {{{careerGoals}}}

  Based on this information, provide your suggestions. The quality of your rationale is critical.`,
